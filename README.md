# Basic C# and .NET Development Project

In this project, I explored the basics of C# and the .NET framework. I started by understanding what C#, .NET, and CLR are, and then set up my development environment. From there, I created a Windows console application entirely from scratch: a number guessing game that I compiled and shared with friends!

Hereâ€™s what I covered:

## Key Concepts
- **What is C#, .NET, and CLR?**
  - **C#:** A modern, object-oriented programming language by Microsoft, used for developing web, desktop, and mobile applications.
  - **.NET Framework:** A development platform providing libraries and tools for building robust applications.
  - **CLR (Common Language Runtime):** The runtime environment that manages the execution of .NET applications, including memory management and security.

- **Installing Visual Studio Community Latest Edition**
  - Set up one of the best IDEs for C# development.

- **Setting up a Console Project**
  - Created a simple text-based program as a starting point to learn core programming principles.

- **Understanding Namespaces, Classes, and Functions**
  - Organised code with namespaces, structured it with classes, and reused logic with functions.

- **Working with Variables and Data Types**
  - Stored and manipulated data using types like `int`, `string`, and `bool`.

- **Customising Console Output**
  - Added colours and took user input to create interactive programs.

- **Using If Statements and While Loops**
  - Implemented decision-making and repetitive logic in code.

## The Project
I built a **Number Guessing Game**, which brought all these concepts together. This project was:
- Interactive, allowing me to practise user input and output.
- Fun, as I shared it with friends to play.
- A practical way to apply my learning and reinforce key programming concepts.

To conclude, a solid foundation in C# programming and a working console application has been showcased.
